# Real Estate

Welcome to my real estate lab! Are you looking to invest in luxury real estate? If you answered yes, now is the perfect time. In this lab, we’ll be taking a look at luxury property listings available around the world. Venture through the code as we browse through current listings with information about the location, square footage of the house, number of beds/baths, and the price of each property.

To get started, you can find all the files you’ll need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem in this directory. Place your Ruby code in the file ‘lib/realestate’. Feeling experimental? Run ‘bin/console’ for an interactive prompt. 

## Objectives

	1. Browse through available luxury properties around the world

	2. Gather information from each of the listings - square footage, number of beds/baths, and location of listing. 


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'realestate'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install realestate

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
