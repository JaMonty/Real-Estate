# Real Estate

Welcome to my real estate lab! Are you looking to invest in luxury real estate? If you answered yes, now is the perfect time. In this lab, we’ll be taking a look at luxury property listings available around the world. Venture through the code as we browse through current listings with information about the location, square footage of the house, number of beds/baths, and the price of each property.

To get started, you can find all the files you’ll need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem in this directory. Place your Ruby code in the file ‘lib/realestate’. Feeling experimental? Run ‘bin/console’ for an interactive prompt. 

## Objectives

	1. Browse through available luxury properties around the world

	2. Gather information from each of the listings - square footage, number of beds/baths, and location of listing. 


## Usage

  <!-- Go into Documents directory, into workspace directory, into learnco directory then realestate directory
  then run 
  ./bin/realestate
  then it will display all the listings
  choose the number of the property and it will display more information as in home specs and price of property.
  type E to exit.
  run ./bin/realestate to start from the beginning again -->
<!-- TODO: Write usage instructions here -->

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
